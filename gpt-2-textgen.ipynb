As a result:\n","\n","- In general, GPT-2 is better at maintaining context over its entire generation length, making it good for generating conversational text. The text is also generally gramatically correct, with proper capitalization and few typoes.\n","- The original GPT-2 model was trained on a very large variety of sources, allowing the model to incorporate idioms not seen in the input text.\n","- GPT-2 can only generate a maximum of 1024 tokens per request (about 3-4 paragraphs of English text).\n","- GPT-2 cannot stop early upon reaching a specific end token. (workaround: pass the truncate parameter to a generate function to only collect text until a specified end token. You may want to reduce length appropriately.)\n","- Higher temperatures work better (e.g. 0.7 - 1.0) to generate more interesting text, while other frameworks work better between 0.2 - 0.5.\n","- When finetuning GPT-2, it has no sense of the beginning or end of a document within a larger text. You'll need to use a bespoke character sequence to indicate the beginning and end of a document. Then while generating, you can specify a prefix targeting the beginning token sequences, and a truncate targeting the end token sequence. You can also set include_prefix=False to discard the prefix token while generating (e.g. if it's something unwanted like <|startoftext|>).\n","- If you pass a single-column .csv file to finetune(), it will automatically parse the CSV into a format ideal for training with GPT-2 (including prepending <|startoftext|> and suffixing <|endoftext|> to every text document, so the truncate tricks above are helpful when generating output). This is necessary to handle both quotes and newlines in each text document correctly.\n","- GPT-2 allows you to generate texts in parallel by setting a batch_size that is divisible into nsamples, resulting in much faster generation. Works very well with a GPU (can set batch_size up to 20 on Colaboratory's K80)!\n","- Due to GPT-2's architecture, it scales up nicely with more powerful GPUs. For the 124M model, if you want to train for longer periods of time, GCP's P100 GPU is about 3x faster than a K80/T4 for only 3x the price, making it price-comparable (the V100 is about 1.5x faster than the P100 but about 2x the price). The P100 uses 100% of the GPU even with batch_size=1, and about 88% of the V100 GPU.\n","- If you have a partially-trained GPT-2 model and want to continue finetuning it, you can set overwrite=True to finetune, which will continue training and remove the previous iteration of the model without creating a duplicate copy. This can be especially useful for transfer learning (e.g. heavily finetune GPT-2 on one dataset, then finetune on other dataset to get a \"merging\" of both datasets).\n","- If your input text dataset is massive (>100 MB), you may want to preencode and compress the dataset using gpt2.encode_dataset(file_path). THe output is a compressed .npz file which will load much faster into the GPU for finetuning.\n","- The 774M \"large\" model may support finetuning because it will cause modern GPUs to go out-of-memory (you may get lucky if you use a P100 GPU on Colaboratory). However, you can still generate from the default pretrained model using gpt2.load_gpt2(sess, model_name='774M') and gpt2.generate(sess, model_name='774M').\n","- The 1558M \"extra large\", true model, may not work out-of-the-box with the GPU included with the Colaboratory Notebook. More testing is needed to identify optimial configurations for it."],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}}]}
